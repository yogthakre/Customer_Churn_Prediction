# Customer Churn Prediction – Mini ML Project

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will churn or not using a basic machine learning model.
It demonstrates data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation using a public dataset.

## Dataset Source
Telecom Customer Churn Dataset (Kaggle / UCI Machine Learning Repository)

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
2. Load the dataset (Telco-Customer-Churn.csv)
3. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook
4. View model accuracy and confusion matrix

## Model Used
Logistic Regression

## Final Result Summary
The Logistic Regression model achieved approximately 96% accuracy.
The confusion matrix shows a reasonable balance between churn and non-churn predictions.

I deployed on Streamlit.
